DESCRIPTION:
The administration is via an infusion (requires INFUSION RATE or INFUSION DURATION column-type in the data set).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).


[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V, Cl}

EQUATION:

; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(V, Cl)
Y = log(Cc)

OUTPUT:
output = Y
